## Welcome to the UPBOT Wiki ##

Are you new to UPBOT and you want to get a demo working?  Consider the GettingStarted page.

Are you new to the sourcebase and looking to contribute code?  Please read the UPBOT CodingStandards so that you code looks its best.

Are you a more advanced user, lacking a static IP and looking for a way to discover your gumstix hardware more easily?  The GumstixNetworkDiscovery page is for you.

Do you need to boot a gumstix from a microSD card?  I'm sorry.  The BurningLinuxImages page has the instructions that we have so far, but we are still in the debugging stages.

Do need details on our new ServiceOrientedArchitecture?

Other information is available at [Dr. Crenshaw's Website](http://kaju.dreamhosters.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=63&Itemid=59)
